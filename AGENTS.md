# RepoArchitecture

## [ARCH]

Preferred architecture:
- modular monolith
- typed interfaces
- service-layer backend
- relational source-of-truth
- vector retrieval subsystem
- Docker-first runtime

Avoid:
- microservices
- distributed orchestration
- speculative abstractions
- event-chaos architecture
- unnecessary infrastructure

Complexity must be earned.

---

# StackRules

## [FRONTEND]

Preferred:
- React
- Tailwind
- shadcn/ui
- React Router

Frontend principles:
- responsive
- readable
- coherent
- lightweight
- minimal cognitive overhead

Avoid:
- excessive animation
- deeply nested state
- abstraction-heavy component systems
- unnecessary frontend complexity

---

## [BACKEND]

Preferred:
- Fastify
- Zod validation
- service-layer logic
- typed APIs
- structured logging

Backend principles:
- deterministic behavior
- modular routes
- observable state
- explicit validation
- debuggable flows

Avoid:
- hidden side effects
- implicit mutation

---

## [DATABASE]

Relational DB:
- canonical source of truth

Vector DB:
- semantic retrieval only

Never store canonical application state inside vector systems.

Preferred:
- normalized schemas
- explicit relations
- migrations
- deterministic persistence

---

## [AI]

AI systems must remain:
- grounded
- observable
- constrained
- testable

Preferred workflow:
1.ContextGather🧠
2.RetrieveRelevant📡
3.StructurePrompt📋
4.Generate⚡
5.Validate🛡️
6.Persist♻️

Avoid:
- autonomous recursive loops
- uncontrolled chain explosion
- context flooding
- unconstrained generation
- speculative “agent swarm” architecture

---

# PromptEngineering

## [PROMPTSTRUCT]

Preferred structure:

```txt
SYSTEM
CURRENT STATE
RELEVANT CONTEXT
CONSTRAINTS
TASK
EXPECTED OUTPUT
```

Avoid large conversational prompt blobs.

---

## [CTXDISC]

Prioritize:
1. active state
2. recent interactions
3. semantically relevant retrievals
4. operational constraints
5. current objective

Avoid:
- full-history injection
- repetitive context
- oversized prompts
- irrelevant retrievals

Tight context>large context.

---

## [OUTPUTDISC]

Prefer:
- JSON outputs
- typed schemas
- deterministic formatting
- explicit state transitions

Validate outputs before persistence.

Never trust raw generations blindly.

---

## [MEMCOMP]

Long histories→compress:
- summaries
- semantic memory
- distilled state
- compressed representations

Avoid infinite transcript accumulation.

# BuildDiscipline

## [BUILDSTATE]

Repository must remain:
- buildable
- deployable
- type-safe
- recoverable

Never leave:
- failing builds
- unresolved imports
- invalid Docker states
- broken environment configs
- abandoned scaffolding

Every checkpoint should work.

---

## [DOCKERFIRST]

Primary runtime:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Avoid machine-specific assumptions.

---

## [ENV]

Use:
- explicit environment variables
- `.env.example`
- deterministic configuration

Never hardcode secrets.

---

# RefactorPolicy

Refactor only when:
- maintainability degrades
- duplication becomes harmful
- debugging becomes difficult
- measurable bottlenecks exist

Avoid:
- aesthetic rewrites
- architecture churn
- speculative redesigns

Preserve stable systems whenever possible.

---

# DependencyPolicy

Before adding dependencies:
1.VerifyNecessity📋
2.VerifyMaintenance🔍
3.VerifyCompatibility🔗
4.VerifyMaturity🏗️

Prefer fewer dependencies.

Dependency count = operational liability.

---

# FileDiscipline

Files should remain:
- focused
- readable
- navigable
- logically scoped

Avoid:
- thousand-line files
- tangled responsibilities
- abstraction forests
- dead utilities

---

# LoggingStandards

Logs should be:
- structured
- timestamped
- actionable
- readable

Avoid:
- noisy spam
- swallowed exceptions
- meaningless traces

---

# FailureProtocol

When failures occur:

1.Reproduce🧪
2.Isolate📍
3.MinimizeBlastRadius🛡️
4.ApplyTargetedFix🔧
5.Retest🔁
6.VerifyRegression🔍

Never panic-refactor.

Never replace stable systems impulsively.

---

# GitDiscipline

Prefer:
- small commits
- stable checkpoints
- meaningful commit messages
- recoverable states

Every completed phase should represent:
- working functionality
- deployable state
- architectural stability

---

# UIPrinciples

Interfaces should feel:
- intentional
- coherent
- responsive
- calm
- readable

Prefer:
- strong spacing
- restrained motion
- predictable interaction
- visual hierarchy

Avoid:
- clutter
- excessive effects
- hidden workflows
- unnecessary interaction complexity

---

# CommStyle

Communicate:
- clearly
- directly
- technically
- concisely

Avoid:
- hype
- speculative certainty
- unnecessary verbosity
- architectural grandstanding

---

# DecisionHierarchy

Priority order:

1.PreserveWorkingSystems🛡️
2.MinimizeComplexity📉
3.MaintainClarity🔍
4.PreserveMaintainability♻️

# DefinitionOfSuccess

Success means:
- systems ship
- builds remain stable
- deployment remains simple
- architecture remains understandable
- iteration remains fast
- debugging remains manageable
- code remains maintainable

The objective is not maximum sophistication.

The objective is:
> stable, maintainable, deployable systems built with disciplined engineering execution.

# PhaseLog

## Phase 4 — Lore Ingestion + Retrieval Pipeline
Date: 2026-05-15

Scope (completed):
- Deterministic chunking service (`chunker.ts`) with sentence/paragraph boundaries
- OpenAI embedding generation service (`embedding.ts`) using `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim)
- Qdrant vector storage service (`qdrant.ts`) with deterministic UUID-based IDs
- Ingest orchestration service (`ingestService.ts`) that fetches lore, chunks, embeds, and upserts
- Semantic search API route (`search.ts`) scoped to `worldId` with metadata join
- Lore detail UI (`Lore.tsx`) with Ingest button and semantic search widget
- Environment config in `.env` and `.env.example`
- Tests: chunker unit tests (4/4 passing); route tests expanded for lore get/ingest (10 passing)

Files added:
- `apps/api/src/services/chunker.ts`
- `apps/api/src/services/embedding.ts`
- `apps/api/src/services/qdrant.ts`
- `apps/api/src/services/ingestService.ts`
- `apps/api/src/routes/search.ts`
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/chunker.test.ts`

Files modified:
- `apps/api/src/services/loreService.ts` — added `getLoreEntryById`
- `apps/api/src/routes/lore.ts` — added `POST /:id/ingest` route
- `apps/api/src/index.ts` — registered `searchRoutes`
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/routes.test.ts` — mocked embedding/qdrant, added lore get + ingest tests
- `apps/web/src/pages/Lore.tsx` — Ingest button + semantic search UI
- `apps/api/src/services/qdrant.ts` — fixed type cast for Qdrant payload
- `.env` / `.env.example` — added embedding/Qdrant variables

Build status: API compiles, frontend compiles, all tests pass (21 total).

Pending:
- 1 high-severity npm audit vulnerability in `apps/api` (needs dependency review)
- End-to-end verification with live Qdrant + OpenAI keys
- Docker-first runtime validation (`docker compose up -d`)

Explicitly excluded per Phase 4 directive:
- Character chat
- Autonomous agents
